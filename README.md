Rails app made in 24h in a team of 4 for a hackathon organised by the EU. 

The app helps people to get informations about the EU's regulations, and gives them a way to carry out administrative procedures. It also gives feedback to the EU by analyzing data (eg: the places in Europe where people have the most complains about a specific topic...).
